# Semantic Suffix Tree Clustering
A Python implementation of Semantic Suffix Tree Clustering algorithm, based on the Janruang and Guha's paper "Semantic Suffix Tree Clustering" https://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~guha/papers/semSufTreeClus.pdf

The  distinctive  methodology  of the  Semantic  Suffix  Tree  Clustering  (SSTC)  algorithm  is  that  it  simultaneously  constructs  the semantic  suffix  tree  through  an  on-depth  and  on-breadth  pass by using semantic similarity and string matching. SSTC uses only subject-verb-object classification to generate clusters and readable labels.

This implementation is available to Indonesian language only.
